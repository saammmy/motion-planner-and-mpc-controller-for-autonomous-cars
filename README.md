# motion-planner-and-mpc-controller-for-autonomous-cars

Note: This repository is under development and will be used for code sharing purposes
The main goal of the project include
1. To develop a motion planner and an MPC controller to follow the given trajectory.
2. Compare the different types of algorithms for Motion Planning
3. Compare the performance of MPC based control when compared to PID control
